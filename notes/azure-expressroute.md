title: Azure ExpressRoute
---

- "Physical" connection from on-prem infrastructure to Azure
- Very fast and reliable
- No involvement of the public internet
- Expensive
- See [[azure-vpn-gateway]] for a cheaper alternative serving the same purpose of connecting on-prem infrastructure.
  - Azure ExpressRoute and Azure VPN Gateway may be used simultaneously for high availability.
