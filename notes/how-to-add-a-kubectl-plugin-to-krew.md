title: How to Add a Kubectl Plugin to Krew
---

If you created a plugin and want to add it to the *krew* index, so that other users can discover and install it via *krew*, you can do that. The instructions for this can be found in the [developer guide](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/krew/blob/master/docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) of the *krew* documentation.

In short, you have create two artefacts for publishing your plugin to *krew*:

- A `.zip` or `.tar.gz` archive containing the executables of your plugin (possibly for different platforms)
- A *krew* [plugin manifest](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/krew/blob/master/docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#writing-a-plugin-manifest) YAML file

The **archive** with the executables must be publicly downloadable via a URL. You can achieve this, for example, by adding it as a binary to a GitHub [release](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/).

The **plugin manifest** must contain all the required information for *krew* to install the plugin. This includes the URL of the archive with the executables, and the names of the executables to install for each platform. The plugin manifest is what will be uploaded to the *krew* index.

To publish your plugin to the *krew* index, you have to create a pull request to the [krew-index](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/krew-index) repository adding your plugin manifest to the [`plugins`](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/krew-index/tree/master/plugins) directory of this repository. This is were the manifests of all the plugins in the *krew* index are maintained.

Once the pull request is accepted, your plugin will be publicly listed by `kubectl krew search` and users can install it with `kubectl install <plugin>`. If you create a new version of your plugin, you have to update your plugin manifest in the krew-index repository with a new pull request.

Again, the detailed instructions for publishing plugins to *krew* can be found in the *krew* [developer guide](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/krew/blob/master/docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md).
