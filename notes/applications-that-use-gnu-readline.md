title: Applications That Use GNU Readline
---

Full usage of Readline:

- Bash
- GDB
- R

Apparent usage of Readline but not using all the features (e.g. not reading `~/.inputrc` or not providing history):

- SQLite
- Python
- Lua

Not using GNU Readline at all:

- zsh
- ksh
- fish
- csh
- Most other shells

> Comment: Bash seems to be the main application that uses Readline. As far as I know, Readline has been developed for Bash, both are GNU projects, and currently both are maintained by the same maintainer (Chet Ramey).
