title: GNU vs Linux
---

The [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/) (GNU is not UNIX) project has been started in 1984 with the goal to create a free and open-source version of UNIX (which was proprietary at this time). To this end, the project created open-source versions of many software packages that were used on UNIX, as well as software that is generally needed for an operating system. This included tools such as GCC, GDB, Bash, Readline, GNU Emacs, GNU grep, GNU sed, Gawk, GnuPG, wget, Gzip, GNU Make, ncurses, Screen, GNOME, GIMP, and [many more](https://www.gnu.org/manual/blurbs.html).

The goal has always been to create a complete operating system that can be used as an alternative to UNIX. By the begining of the 90s, the situation was that a lot of software has been created, but one central piece was still missing: a kernel. Thus, the GNU project started developing its own kernel named [Hurd](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html) in 1990.

At about the same time (1990--1991), Linus Torvalds started developing the Linux kernel as an alternative for the UNIX kernel. This happend independently of the GNU project. In 1991 the Linux kernel was released, much before the GNU Hurd kernel was ready. Now all the pieces to create a complete open-source operating system were available. People started taking the Linux kernel and combine it with the many GNU tools to create complete open-source operating system distributions.

The most popular name that people used for these operating systems consisting of the Linux kernel and the GNU tools was "Linux" rather than "GNU". Today, operating systems based on this configuration are mainly known as Linux.

This was of course against the goals of the GNU project founders. Now, their long-standing goal of a complete operating system was achieved, but it was called Linux rather than GNU. This sparked a controversy about the correct name for these systems that lasts until today. In short, the GNU project [defends the position](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html) that operating systems based on the Linux kernel and the GNU tools should be called GNU/Linux rather than just Linux.

In my view, people in the early 90s adopted the name Linux rather than GNU simply because it's a much better name:

- It sounds much better than GNU (of which it's not clear whether it's word or acronym, how to pronounce it, etc.)
- It sounds similar to UNIX which was a well-known term at this time (and which is also a nice-sounding name)
